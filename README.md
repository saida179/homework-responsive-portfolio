I enjoyed working on this homework assignment, although I had a heard time committing  
and pushing my homework at first. Theirs something that I wish I could have work on a little.

For this assignment I have created a portfolio page where you can fine basic info about myself and link to different projects that I have been working on for my coding bootcamp class.
